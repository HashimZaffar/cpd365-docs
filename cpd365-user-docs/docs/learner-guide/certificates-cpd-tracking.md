# **Certificates & CPD Tracking**

CPD365 automatically records every course you complete and generates a CPD certificate you can download, store, or share with your workplace.
Your CPD hours are then added to your personal **CPD Portfolio**, keeping you audit-ready at all times.

This page explains how certificates are created, where to find them, how CPD hours are recorded, and how to export your full CPD history.

## **How Certificates Work**

Once you complete a course:

1. All modules are marked complete
2. You pass the final quiz
3. A background process generates your certificate
4. Your CPD hours are added to your portfolio
5. You receive a completion notification

Certificates typically generate **within 5–10 seconds**.

Each certificate includes:

* Your full name
* Course title
* CPD hours earned
* Completion date
* Instructor name
* Unique certificate ID (for verification)
* CPD365 branding and validation seal

📄 *Placeholder Image:*

You never need to manually request a certificate — everything is automated.

## **CPD Hours Explained**

Each CPD365 course lists the number of hours you will earn upon completion.
Examples:

* Short course → **0.5 to 1 CPD hour**
* Intermediate course → **1.5 to 2 CPD hours**
* Full competency programs → **3+ CPD hours**

### How CPD Hours Are Calculated

Hours are based on:

* Estimated lesson duration
* Interactive components
* Required readings
* Clinical scenario time

These values are aligned with standard CPD frameworks used by Australian healthcare regulators.

!!! note
CPD365 logs only the hours earned from your completed CPD365 courses.
You may record external CPD separately (if supported by your organization).

---

## **Yearly CPD Summary**

At the top of your CPD Portfolio, you’ll see:

* **CPD hours earned** this year
* **Hours required** (e.g., 20 hours for many clinicians)
* A visual progress bar
* A reset date (your registration renewal date)

Example:

> **14 / 20 CPD hours completed**
> Renewal date: 31 May

The summary updates instantly when you complete a new course.
