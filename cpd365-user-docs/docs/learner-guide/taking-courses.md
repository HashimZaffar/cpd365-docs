# **Taking Courses**

The CPD365 learning experience is designed to be intuitive, distraction-free, and optimized for quick clinical learning.
Whether you’re studying during a shift break or from home, the course player helps you move smoothly through modules, track your progress, and apply what you’ve learned.

This guide explains how to navigate lessons, complete modules, use learning tools, and finish the final assessment.

---

## **Course Player Overview**

When you open a course, you’ll see a clean three-panel layout:

* **Left Panel: Module & Lesson List**
  (Your roadmap for the course)

* **Center Panel: Content Viewer**
  (Videos, slides, scenarios, quizzes)

* **Right Panel: Tools & Resources**
  (Notes, attachments, transcripts, additional materials)

This structure mirrors familiar streaming and e-learning platforms (*Jakob’s Law*), making it easy to learn without a steep curve.

## **Left Panel: Module List**

The left panel keeps your place in the course consistent and predictable.

You’ll see:

* Module headers (expand/collapse)
* Lesson titles
* Completion checkmarks
* Locked modules (if learning is sequential)

### Completion Indicators

Each lesson displays one of the following:

* ⬜ **Not Started**
* 🟦 **In Progress**
* ✅ **Completed**

These indicators follow strong **visibility & feedback** principles — learners always know exactly where they are.

!!! note
Some courses require completing lessons **in order**. Locked lessons display a small padlock icon.

---

## **Center Panel: Lesson Content**

This is the primary learning area. Lessons may include:

### 🎬 **Video Lessons**

* Short, high-quality clips (3–10 minutes)
* Play/pause, speed control, captions
* Automatically mark as complete after required watch time

### 📚 **Slide Decks**

* Tap/click to advance slides
* Ideal for clinical guidelines and protocols

### 🧩 **Interactive Scenarios**

Case-based clinical simulations designed to sharpen decision-making.

### 📝 **Knowledge Checks**

Mini-quizzes inside lessons for better retention.

### 🔗 **Linked Resources**

External guidelines, clinical references, downloadable PDFs.

---

## **Right Panel: Learning Tools**

The right panel supports deeper engagement without clutter.

### 🗒️ **Notes**

Write personal notes as you learn.
Notes automatically save and can be exported to your CPD Portfolio.

### 📄 **Attachments**

Download PDFs, clinical checklists, or printable protocols.

### 🎧 **Transcripts**

Text version of video lessons — improving accessibility and supporting WCAG compliance.

### 💬 **Discussion (Optional)**

Some courses include discussion prompts for reflecting or asking questions.

!!! tip
Use the Notes tool to capture key takeaways — they appear in your CPD log as reflective practice evidence.

---

## **Automatic Progress Tracking**

As you complete lessons, CPD365:

* Updates your progress bar
* Marks lessons as complete
* Unlocks the next module (when applicable)
* Saves your position automatically

Your course progress is stored securely in the cloud —
no need to manually save or worry about closing your browser mid-lesson.

---

## **Quizzes & Assessments**

Most courses end with a **short quiz** to confirm understanding.

### Quiz Features

* Typically 5–10 questions
* Multiple-choice, scenario-based, or interactive
* One question per screen (reduces cognitive load)
* Instant feedback after completion
* **Unlimited attempts** (unless restricted by your organization)

### Passing Score

* Usually **70% or higher**
* If you fail, you’ll see which content to review

!!! tip
CPD365 quizzes are designed to reinforce learning — not trick you.

---

## **Course Completion**

You’ll know your course is complete when:

* All module checkmarks are green
* The quiz shows **Passed**
* A completion banner appears at the top of the player
* Your CPD hours are added to your **CPD Portfolio**
* A downloadable certificate is generated automatically

### Completion Banner Example:

> **🎉 Course Completed!**
> Your certificate is now available in your CPD Portfolio.

Click **Download Certificate** or return to your dashboard.

---

## **Resuming a Course Later**

You can pause at any time.

To resume:

1. Go to your **Dashboard**
2. Under **In Progress**, select your course
3. You’ll land exactly where you left off

This minimizes friction and supports nurses and clinicians who learn in short windows throughout the day.

---

## **Learning on Mobile**

The course player is optimized for touch interactions:

* Large tap targets (Fitts’s Law)
* Stacked layout for small screens
* Swipable modules list
* Video controls optimized for thumb reach (Thumb Zone principles)
* Offline-friendly buffering for poor hospital Wi-Fi

!!! tip
Many learners complete CPD on mobile while commuting or during short breaks — CPD365 is designed around real clinical schedules.
