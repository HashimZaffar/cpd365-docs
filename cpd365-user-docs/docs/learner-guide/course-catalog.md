# **Browsing the Course Catalog**

The **Course Catalog** is where you’ll discover all CPD courses available to you.
It’s designed to feel familiar, intuitive, and fast — whether you’re browsing casually or searching with a specific goal in mind.

This page will show you how to explore the catalog, use filters, preview course content, and find the most relevant CPD activities for your practice.

## **What You’ll See in the Course Catalog**

The catalog is organized to help you make decisions quickly, while avoiding information overload.

When you open the catalog, you’ll see:

* **Search bar** (top)
* **Filter panel** (left or collapsible on mobile)
* **Course cards** (center grid)
* **Category shortcuts** (top row)
* **Badges** (Free, New, Recommended, Required)

📸 *Placeholder Screenshot:*

## **Using the Search Bar**

At the top of the catalog:

```
🔍 Search courses…
```

You can search by:

* Course name (*e.g., “ECG Interpretation”*)
* Topics (*e.g., “Mental Health”*)
* Clinical areas (*e.g., “Aged Care”, “Midwifery”*)
* Keywords (*e.g., “sepsis”, “communication”*)

Search results update instantly.

!!! tip
Search minimizes effort and cognitive load — ideal when you already know the type of course you need.

## **Course Cards**

Each course card includes:

* Course title

* Category
* Difficulty
* Badge (e.g., *NEW*, *POPULAR*, *FREE*)

## **Badges and Indicators**

To help you scan the catalog faster, badges highlight special courses:

* 🆓 **FREE**
* 🆕 **NEW**
* ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
* 📘 **REQUIRED** (assigned by your organization)
* 📈 **TRENDING**

These badges increase visual contrast (Von Restorff Effect), making important items easier to notice.

---

## **Sorting Options**

At the top of the catalog grid, you can sort by:

* Most popular
* Newly added
* CPD hours (low → high / high → low)
* Difficulty
* Title (A–Z)

This helps learners with different goals prioritize quickly, reducing decision fatigue.

---

## **Category Shortcuts**

Across the top row of the catalog, you’ll find large category buttons:

* Mental Health
* Child & Neonatal
* NDIS Programs
* Cardiac Care
* Aged Care
* Emergency Care

These shortcuts follow **Fitts’s Law**: large, easy-to-tap targets that reduce navigation time.

---

## **Finding Organization-Assigned Courses**

If your organization has assigned required courses or annual competency programs, you’ll see a **Required for You** section at the top of the catalog.

This ensures essential training is never missed.

!!! warning
Some assigned courses may have due dates set by your organization.
Assigned courses always appear before optional courses.

---

## **Mobile Experience**

The mobile catalog is optimized for touch interactions:

* Filters collapse into a slide-out drawer
* Course cards become full-width for clearer readability
* Enrol buttons remain large and centered for easy tapping
* Bottom navigation is used for quick access to Dashboard, Catalog, and CPD Log

This follows both **Fitts’s Law** and **Thumb Zone** usability principles.

---

## **Accessibility Considerations**

CPD365’s catalog includes:

* High-contrast text
* WCAG-compliant color palette
* ARIA labels for assistive technologies
* Keyboard navigation
* Responsive text sizes

Users of all abilities can browse courses comfortably.
