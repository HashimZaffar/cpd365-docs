# **Assigning Courses & Programs**

As an Organization Admin or Team Manager, you can assign individual courses or full competency programs to your learners.
This helps ensure staff complete mandatory training, stay up-to-date with regulatory requirements, and maintain compliance across clinical teams.

This guide walks you through assigning training, setting due dates, monitoring progress, and managing ongoing requirements.

---

## **Where to Assign Courses**

To begin assigning training:

1. Open the **Admin Dashboard**
2. Select **Courses & Programs**
3. Click **Assign Training**

You’ll see a streamlined, step-by-step assignment workflow designed to minimize complexity (Hick’s Law).

---

## **Assignment Types**

CPD365 supports two assignment categories:

### **1. Individual Courses**

Ideal for:

* New staff onboarding
* Annual updates (e.g., Hand Hygiene)
* Targeted learning for specific gaps
* Optional professional development

### **2. Competency Programs**

Programs bundle multiple courses into a structured pathway.
Examples:

* **Annual Nurse Competency Pack**
* **NDIS High-Intensity Support Program**
* **Aged Care Clinical Skills Refresh**

Programs automate sequencing and tracking, reducing admin overhead.

---

## **Step 1: Select Courses or Programs**

Use the selector interface to choose:

* One or multiple courses
* One program
* A combination of required and optional courses

### UI Features:

* Search by title or keyword
* Filter by category
* Long lists collapse for scanability
* Courses show CPD hours, difficulty, and badges

!!! tip
Use Programs for predictable, repeatable learning (e.g., annual competencies).

---

## **Step 2: Choose Who to Assign To**

You can assign training to:

### **• Individual Learners**

Use the searchable list to select one or more staff.

### **• Entire Teams**

Perfect for department-wide rollouts (e.g., ED, ICU, Aged Care Wing).

### **• The Entire Organization**

Common for:

* Onboarding
* Mandatory regulatory training
* Annual compliance cycles

### **• Dynamic Groups (If enabled)**

Groups auto-update based on:

* Role
* Profession
* Location
* Specialty

This reduces ongoing maintenance for large organizations.

!!! note
Selecting a Team includes all current members. New team members can be auto-enrolled if enabled.

---

## **Step 3: Set Due Dates & Reminders**

Adding a due date provides clarity and helps motivate timely completion.

### Options:

* **No due date**
* **Specific date**
* **Relative deadline**
  (e.g., “30 days from assignment”)

### Reminder Emails:

Admins can toggle reminders:

* 7 days before
* 3 days before
* On due date
* After due date (overdue notice)

Reminders follow **Error Prevention** and **Status Visibility**, ensuring learners don’t miss deadlines.

---

## **Step 4: Customize Assignment Settings**

This section appears only when needed — following **Progressive Disclosure**.

### Available Settings:

* **Allow course unenrollment**
* **Require sequential completion**
* **Restrict retakes**
* **Show course as ‘Required’ on learner dashboard**
* **Assignment message** (shown to learners when assigned)

### Example assignment message:

> *“This course is required for all ICU staff and must be completed by March 15. Please contact your Nurse Educator if you have questions.”*

---

## **Step 5: Review & Confirm**

CPD365 provides a final confirmation screen summarizing:

* Courses/programs selected
* Learners or teams receiving the assignment
* Due dates
* Reminder schedule
* Any custom options

If everything looks correct, click:

### **Assign Training**

This button is intentionally large and high-contrast (Fitts’s Law), reducing error rate and improving confidence.

---

## **What Learners See**

Once assigned:

* Courses appear in the learner’s **Dashboard → Required for You** section
* Due dates display on course cards
* Learners receive an email notification
* Required modules appear at the top of the Course Catalog

This aligns with **Status Visibility** and ensures required training never goes unnoticed.

---

## **Tracking Assignment Progress**

Admins can monitor learning progress through:

### **Course Progress Dashboard**

Shows:

* Number of learners assigned
* % started
* % completed
* Pending deadlines
* Overdue alerts
* Team-by-team completion breakdown

### **Learner-Level View**

Drill down to view:

* Individual lesson progress
* Quiz results
* Certificate status
* Reflection notes

### **Export Options**

* CSV
* PDF (audit-ready layout)

These tools support accreditation audits and quality improvement initiatives.

---

## **Managing Ongoing Assignments**

### **Resend Assignment Emails**

Useful for new staff or reminders.

### **Extend or Modify Due Dates**

Especially for shift workers or clinical rotations.

### **Reassign to New Teams**

Assignments automatically follow the learner if role/team changes.

### **Archive Completed Assignments**

Keeps the dashboard clean and focused.

---

## **Reassigning or Removing Learners**

To add/remove learners from an existing assignment:

1. Open the assignment
2. Click **Modify Learners**
3. Add or remove individuals or teams
4. Save changes

!!! warning
Removing a learner does **not** delete their historical progress or certificates.

---

## **Troubleshooting Assignment Issues**

### Learner doesn’t see the assigned course?

* Ensure the assignment was confirmed
* Check if they belong to the correct team
* Confirm their account is active
* Verify the course is visible to their organization

### Program appears incomplete?

* Some programs require sequential progression
* Ensure all prerequisite modules are completed

### Due date incorrect?

* Confirm whether a relative or absolute due date was set
* Modify dates from the assignment settings
